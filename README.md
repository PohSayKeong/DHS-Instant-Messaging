# DHS-Instant-Messaging
Send a push notification to anyone in DHS

This app is meant to send immediate notification to students of DHS.
It aims to make the process of delivering instant messages to a large audience more effective.
This has always been a problem as
- morning announcements do not capture 100% attention of students
- student and teachers do not know who to look for when they need to contact people from a certain CCA/class
- students do not have the habit of checking their emails
- spam emails about things people are not interested in
